        Chicken cutlets are one of life's little pleasures. And when they are done well
        they can be otherworldly. Chicken cutlets remind me of my childhood. Growing up
        my mother used to make them on every Sunday, which for an italian women was a
        little strange. She was never the one to make Sunday sauce, but she always had a plate
        of fried chicken cutlets ready for her 3 boys.

        A chicken cutlet is a blank slate on which to paint with flavors. It can be elevated to
        a level beyond imagination with any amount of skill (or spice). There are many recipes
        that call for a chicken cutlet as the base. This recipe will be the best baseline to make those dishes.
        Or to just enjoy as their own meal!
