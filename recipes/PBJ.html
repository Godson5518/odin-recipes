        While it may seem simple, this classic dish is a surefire crowdpleaser (assuming you don't have anyone with nut allergies).
        The peanut butter and jelly is also a versatile vessel for many of your other favorite foods.
        I recommend trying some wild flavors once you feel comfortable with the base recipe.
